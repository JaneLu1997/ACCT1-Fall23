                              I 
                            said  Come in Make yourselves at home I opened my glittering jaw My hunger 
                           too   has both hard and soft parts  The only teeth I have are human teeth I 
                          re-   mind him gently before opening his throat  for the ocean so loved  the 
                         quart  feldspar  the tiny home of tiny creatures    that she ground them into 
                   sand  to keep them close to kiss them with well i suppose you would call it a mouth    
                    Scraped every dead daughter from my silly maw . . Next time I grew three extra rows 
                      of seeds Hid them in my mouth Sharpened them to my teeth  i have only ever wanted 
                          to bite down hard on whatever was offered to my 
                          hothouse mouth Our mouths tearing at what bones 
                          we found grinning and hungry for something we 
                     put our mouths on the least lovable
                 the too-full, the easy-bruised . . .
               and canned that hunger and spooned 
            it into our mouths on the coldest 
           days I made my mouth a jar    . . 
          I scooped up the foam         and 
         called it language The        aud-
        ience applauded    Will       you 
        feed and feed       and lick the 
        bowl clean when     we both full? 
       I reach up in-
       side myself, 
       move my mouth. 
      I make it do 
      terrible things
     terrible I drink 
    and drink their 
   looking, til Im soaked. 
  I drink and drown in want. 
I drink, and choke.</pre>
