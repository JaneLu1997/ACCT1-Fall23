            <p>To think about the assignment, I took inspiration from the rotating and shifting fan.</p>

            <p>Starting from thinking about line and rotation, I initially ideated the movement and math as shown in my hand draft:</p>
        </div>

            <p>Based on our very initial math, I have 9 rotating lines lined up. We have the ideal movement, however the fan wasn't being drawn</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/jadedpineapple/full/GQbfFQHZn" width="600" height="400"></iframe>
            <p>After doing some research, I understand that to keep the movement and have the lines leaving tracks behind, we'd have to introduce lineSegment. And here's a reference fanning code I pulled from the internet. I was mainly thinking about how to inter exchange the variable i with my initial value of i. </p>

            <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/jadedpineapple/full/Vy7VFCSys" width="600" height="400"></iframe>
            <p>Combining my code with the reference code's variable, I got some result. However it is not what I want. I realized I should define my "i" value differently from what I originally thought.</p>
        </div>

            <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/jadedpineapple/full/TBH8o-8vC" width="600" height="400"></iframe>
            <p>Going back to the reference code I pulled, I modified it to keep the original movement, and change fanRadius and line length to what I desire. I duplicated the code to constantly translate the starting point and drew each circles seperately, adjusting speed and position each on their own</p>

        <h1>My Question:</h1>
        <div class="statement">How could I simplify the code, instead of drawing 9 circles manually?</div>
